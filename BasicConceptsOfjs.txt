SCOPE->
1)Globally Scoped variable is declared outside a function.

2)Function Scoped is declared within a function.

2)Block Scoped is declared within a block.

A]Var->

1)var is used for variable declaration.

2)var is function/local scoped.

3)var variables can be re-declared and updated.

4)Hoisting of var->var variables are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with a value of undefined.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

B]Let->

1)let is used for variable declaration.

2)let is block scoped.

3)let can be updated but not re-declared.

4)Hoisting of let->let keyword are hoisted to the top of their scope and its not initialized.
	           So if you try to use a let variable before declaration, you'll get a Reference Error.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

B]Const->

const is same as let but you cannot reassign the values

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Synchronous and Asynchronous->

Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program, 
whereas asynchronous code execution allows to execution of the upcoming instructions immediately. 
Because of asynchronous programming we can avoid the blocking of tasks due to the previous instructions

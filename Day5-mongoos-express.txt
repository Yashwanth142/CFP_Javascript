Mongoose->

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and 
is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

Mongoose allows users to conveniently create and manage data in MongoDB.

Mongoose provides 2 ways of doing this, methods and statics. Methods adds an instance method to documents 
whereas Statics adds static "class" methods to the Models itself.

Methods of MongoDB-->CRUD Opration

1]Create->

insertOne()
insertMany()

2]Read/Retrieve
find()
findOne()

3]Update

updateOne()
updateMany()

4]Delete

deleteOne()
deleteMany()

MongoDB Data API

Express->

1.Develops Node.js web applications quickly and easily.
2.It’s simple to set up and personalise.
3.Allows you to define application routes using HTTP methods and URLs.
4.Includes a number of middleware modules that can be used to execute additional requests and responses activities.
5.Simple to interface with a variety of template engines, including Jade, Vash, and EJS.
6.Allows you to specify a middleware for handling errors.

express js
Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application.
It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.

express json
json() is a built-in middleware function in Express. This method is used to parse the incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based upon the bodyparser. This method returns the middleware that 
only parses JSON and only looks at the requests where the content-type header matches the type option.

Syntax:

express.json( [options] )

So the difference is express. json() is a body parser for post request except html post form and express. 
urlencoded({extended: false}) is a body parser for html post form.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
npm->

npm stands for Node Package Manager. It's a library and registry for JavaScript software packages.
npm also has command-line tools to help you install the different packages and manage their dependencies

npm install -g express-api-cli  this installs the express-api-cli globally on your computer
exp-api create test-project

with the help of express-api-cli
you can start a new project faster with pre-configured packages.
Reduce time taken to configure your project.
Express-api-cli allows you to generate different files for different parts of your project such as (controller,services,routes,test),etc

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CORS->

CORS or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing in Node.js is a mechanism by which a front-end client can make requests
for resources to an external back-end server.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Helmet->

Helmet helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.

Helmet and Cors are 2 important node. js packages with different purposes. Helmet secures your express app by setting response HTTP headers appropriately, 
while Cors enables your express application access control to allow restricted resources from being accessed from external domains

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Routing->

Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, 
which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

The Router is just there to help you organize the application across multiple modules

Need of Routing->

Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.

Route definition takes the following structure:

app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
Where:

app is an instance of express.
METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
PATH is a path on the server.
HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTPPS status code->

An HTTP status code is a server response to a browser's request. 
When you visit a website, your browser sends a request to the site's server,and the server then responds to the browser's request with a three-digit code: the HTTP status code

Informational responses ( 100 – 199 )
Successful responses (200 – 299)
Redirection messages (300 – 399)
Client error responses (400 – 499)
Server error responses (500 – 599)

1)1xx: Informational
  It means the request has been received and the process is continuing.

100 Continue	   			
101 Switching Protocols			

2)2xx: Successful

200 OK	        			
202 Accepted				
203 Non-authoritative Information	
204 No Content				
205 Reset Content			

3)3xx: Redirection
It means further action must be taken in order to complete the request.

300 Multiple Choices			
301 Moved Permanently			
302 Found				
303 See Other				
304 Not Modified			
305 Use Proxy				
306 Unused				
307 Temporary Redirect			

4)4xx: Client Error
It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled.

400 Bad Request				
401 Unauthorized			
402 Payment Required			
403 Forbidden				
404 Not Found				
406 Not Acceptable			
407 Proxy Authentication Required	
408 Request Timeout			
409 Conflict				
410 Gone				
411 Length Required			
415 Unsupported Media Type		
417 Expectation Failed	
		
5)5xx: Server Error
500 Internal Server Error	
501 Not Implemented	
502 Bad Gateway	
503 Service Unavailable	
504 Gateway Timeout	
505 HTTP Version Not Supported	

HTTPS method->

The result meaning of "success" depends on the HTTP method: GET : The resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body.
HEAD : The representation headers are included in the response without any message body. PUT or POST : 
The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Schema->

A  schema is just a map of keys and types: That's the same as using a type property: 
A schema can also be a map between keys and default values
schema is a new way of describing object schemas in JavaScript.
It has a clean and simple syntax, and it is capable of serializing to/from the JSON Schema format.
The typical use case is declarative object validation

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MCV->

MVC is abbreviated as Model View Controller is a design pattern created for developing applications specifically web applications. 
As the name suggests, it has three major parts. The traditional software design pattern works in an "Input - Process - Output" pattern 
whereas MVC works as "Controller -Model - View" approach. With the emergence of the MVC model, creation of application takes different aspects individually into consideration. 

These aspects of the application are:
UI Logic
Input logic
Business Logic

Model->
The Model encloses the clean application related data.
But the model does not deal with any logic about how to present the data.
Model: Model represents the shape of the data.

Controller: The Controller is in between the model and the view element. 
It listens to all the incident and actions triggered in the view and performs an appropriate response back to the events.

Controller: The controller handles the user request. Typically, the user uses the view and raises 
an HTTP request, which will be handled by the controller. 
The controller processes the request and returns the appropriate view as a response

View: The View element is used for presenting the data of the model to the user. 
This element deals with how to link up with the model's data but doesn't provide any 
logic regarding what this data all about or how users can use these data.

View: View in MVC is a user interface. View display model data to the user and also enables them to modify them.
View in ASP.NET MVC is HTML, CSS, and some special syntax (Razor syntax) that makes it easy to 
communicate with the model and the controller.

MVC stands for Model, View and Controller.
Model represents the data
View is the User Interface.
Controller is the request handler.
